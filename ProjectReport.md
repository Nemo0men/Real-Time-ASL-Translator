## Project Title:
SignScribe: An AI powered real time sign language translator platform

## Project Description:
Communication barriers exist for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as sign language is not universally understood. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a portable, AI-driven device capable of recognizing sign language gestures in real-time using an Arduino TinyML kit. By translating hand gestures into text or speech, this system can facilitate smoother interactions

## Key Objectives:
Develop a Real-Time Gesture Recognition Model: Train and deploy a deep learning model on the Arduino TinyML kit that accurately recognizes sign language gestures in real time.

## Technology Stack: 
Ardunio TinyML Kit, Ardunio Nano 33 BLE; OV7675 Camera; Micro USB cable

## Software:
Ardunio IDE; Python Compiler (VS code), Edge Impulse, Google Collab
